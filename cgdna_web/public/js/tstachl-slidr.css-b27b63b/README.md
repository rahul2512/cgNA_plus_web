# slidr.css
A standalone CSS library for sliders. No Javascript needed!

This library was inspired by [chinchang' hint.css](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css). It is also written in pure CSS and does not rely on JavaScript. The original `checkbox` is kept which means you can simply add a span with the `slidr` class and you have a checkbox designed like a slider. Nothing else changes it uses the `:checked` pseudo selector to apply the styles.

## Sample Code

		<label class="checkbox">
			<!--
				Note the data-on and data-off attributes to set text for the states.
				Possible additional classes (alla Bootstrap) are:
					* slidr-info
					* slidr-success
					* slidr-warning
					* slidr-danger
					* slidr-inverse
			-->
			<input type="checkbox">
			<span class="slidr" data-on="ON" data-off="OFF"></span>
			Option one is this and thatâ€”be sure to include why it's great
		</label>

## Styles
`slidr.css` was built on top of Twitter Bootstrap, therefor I added the default styles which are used for labels, badges, buttons and so on.

- `.slidr-info`
- `.slidr-success`
- `.slidr-warning`
- `.slidr-danger`
- `.slidr-inverse`

### Transitions
Currently transitions on pseudo elements is only available in Firefox and Internet Explorer 10. But in case the Chrome update comes available in the next few weeks I added transitions for all browsers.

## Get Started
1. Download the source, the combined or minified version from GitHub:
	- [https://raw.github.com/tstachl/slidr.css/master/slidr.min.css](https://raw.github.com/tstachl/slidr.css/master/slidr.min.css) (minified)
	- [https://raw.github.com/tstachl/slidr.css/master/slidr.css](https://raw.github.com/tstachl/slidr.css/master/slidr.css) (combined)
2. Include them as stylesheets in your page.
3. Create a checkbox with the new `slidr` class:

		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="slidr"></span>

4. If you need a green slider use `slidr-success`:

		<input type="checkbox">
		<span class="slidr slidr-success"></span>

That's it now get cracking ...
